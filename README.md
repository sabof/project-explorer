## Main customizable variables:

##### pe/project-root-function

    Function that will locate the project root from the current
    `default-directory`

##### pe/directory-tree-function

    Indexing backend. One of `pe/get-directory-tree-async' (native,
    asynchronous), `pe/get-directory-tree-simple'(native, synchronous) or
    `pe/get-directory-tree-external' (external, asynchronous, requires
    "find" with GNU extensions)

##### pe/cache-enabled

    Whether to use caching

##### pe/omit-regex

    Files and directories matching this regex won't be traversed

##### pe/omit-gitignore

    Omit files based on .gitignore. Directories containing only ignored files won't be shown.

##### pe/side

    Set to 'left or 'right, depending on which side you want the sidebar to appear

##### pe/width

    The width of the sidebar when it first appears

## Tailor-fitting pe/project-root-function

The default `pe/project-root-function` assumes that the project root will be the closest directory containing `.git`, or the current directory. If you have `projectile` installed, it will simply use `projectile-project-root` instead. Should you need something more specific, it's not hard to make your own project-finding function.

```emacs-lisp
(defun pe/project-root-function-sample ()
  (expand-file-name
   (or
    ;; A specific directory
    (when (string-prefix-p "/path/to/my/project/" default-directory)
      "/path/to/my/project/")
    ;; A directory containing a file
    (locate-dominating-file default-directory "Web.config")
    default-directory)))

(setq pe/project-root-function 'pe/project-root-function-sample)
```
